### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ currently I am working on an online store called Pumba, located in the nextdrf repository. The backend is built with Django using ORM models and an admin panel for managing the website content or database entries, which is powered by PostgreSQL. The connection between the backend and frontend is established using the Django REST Framework library, and user authentication is handled using the djoser library with standard token authentication. The frontend is developed with Next.js 14, utilizing components from React.

This project serves as a showcase of my proficiency in Python and JavaScript programming languages, utilizing frameworks such as Django and Next.js. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to develop both back-end and front-end components and seamlessly integrate them using RESTful APIs powered by the Django Rest Framework. Additionally, I have created models and connected a PostgreSQL database to further enhance data management and persistence capabilities.
